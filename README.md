# Help-ME-SEE
Our goal is to develop an application that can efficiently behave as an alternative for a blind person’s eyes
"Help Me See“ will tell them the right directions by considering the user’s path and the objects detected along the way whether they are in front of or close to the user
Also, has the ability to allow the user to send an SMS message “help request” to one or more persons from his contacts section  
This SMS message contains request of the blind user’s need that is also mentioning the important need for a reply and his location
